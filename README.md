- **CSS3**: For styling the user interface, including the weather card and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For all application logic, including:
    - Making API requests using the `fetch` API.
    - Handling user input and events.
    - Interacting with the browser's Geolocation API.
    - Dynamically updating the DOM with fetched weather data.
